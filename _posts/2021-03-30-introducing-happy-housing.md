We have all had terrible experiences renting. We started this journey with one objective in mind: **reform housing renting in Ireland**. One year on, we are months away from launching our new housing rental platform, Happy Housing.

Happy Housing is **an all-in-one online platform** for managing the **housing rental process** from start to finish. This results in **less stress**, better **organisation** and clearer **communication** during the application process and the tenancy. 

We want to make renting a house as straight-forward as booking a hotel or ordering a takeaway. 

## Applicants

We understand there is no one-size-fits-all filter we all use when scrolling through listings, so we offer a more **advanced search** experience for applicants. You will have the option to filter your searches to meet your specific needs. For example, you may search for an *apartment* that *allows smokers*, *allows pets* and has *on-street parking*.

Our goal is to provide you with a start-to-finish application journey. Not only will Happy Housing serve as tool for searching for properties, but you will also have the ability to save **customised searches**, and receive **notifications** once properties matching your search become available. Additionally, if the property owner has enabled it, you will have the option to **submit an application** via Happy Housing where you can collate all your information in one place and submit it once your initial application has been accepted. And finally (we left the best part for last), you will hear back. **Yes - whether you have been rejected or accepted, you will receive a response.** 

## Landlords

Unlike the current rental platforms available in Ireland we, not only provide a **solution to advertising your property online** but, provide a space where you can receive and view all your applications in one place, **interact with your applicants** and **manage the tenancy** once the lease is signed.

### What are the benefits of considering Happy Housing?
- We guarantee to save you time and effort.
- You will be able to **view and manage all your applications** in one place.
- You will no longer need to include your personal phone number or email address on your ads, if you choose not to.
- You will have a **centralised place to organise and manage all your information**.

### How do we do all this?
When you sign up to Happy Housing you will have a **dedicated dashboard** that will contain the **tenant management tool**, **applications** section, **property management page**, **chat** function and your own profile.

## Tenants 

You become a ‘tenant’ once you have signed the lease. 
You may have a pre-existing account with Happy Housing from your application stage – or you may have joined the site at your landlord’s request. Whatever the reason, you will have an account on the site where you can **organise all of your information in one place**. 
### What we can do for you!
- You will have a **dedicated space** to organise all your documents and files.
- You will have more **open communication with your landlord** to receive the support you need during your tenancy.
- Once your current tenancy is finished, you will have all your information in one place, ready to start the application process all over again.
- …and much more.

*The future of renting is coming…*
